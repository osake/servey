Borrowing heavily from:

* http://dhotson.tumblr.com/post/271733389/a-simple-chat-server-in-node-js
* http://github.com/ry/node_chat

to create my own little node client/server experiment.  I haven't added any
versioning to this project yet as it is still very experimental.

Requirements:

* node.js
* redis
* redis-node-client

To start the server:

ensure node is running
$ node intermediate.js

Then telnet to localhost 7000
